# Feedback

## Functionality

### Positive

- is displayed at the bottom and shows preview contents
- can be toggled
- handle has transition
- is responsive

### Negative

- handle is half invisable
- handle should extend the container to the top, but instead is inside the container
- expanding / collapsing has no transition

## Code Style & Quality

### Positive

- code is reduced to the minimum necessary
- uses tailwind
- no css at all

### Negative

- did not include no example component, only copy of html from prompt
- does not build
    ```
    NG8103: The `*ngIf` directive was used in the template, but neither the `NgIf` directive nor the `CommonModule` was imported. Use Angular's built-in control flow @if or make sure that either the `NgIf` directive or the `CommonModule` is included in the `@Component.imports` array of this component.
    ```
    ```
    NG8002: Can't bind to 'ngClass' since it isn't a known property of ':svg:svg'.
    ```
    - manually fixed by importing CommonModule
- no signs of modern angular
    - no standalone component
    - no control flow syntax
    - no signals
- added css file without using it

## Notes

- manually added `standalone: true` to make it work without a dedicated module

## Summary

- output is not more than a starter and needs manual improvements
- code style is good and potentially ready for production
- sadly the component does not fully work as intended
