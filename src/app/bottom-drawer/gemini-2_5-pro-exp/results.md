## Functionality

### Positive

- looks nice and works
- actually has the top center half circle button
- it is responsive

### Negative

- height should depend on content height but is actually calculated relatively to view height
- content not scrollable if overflowing
- top center half circle button drops a shadow onto the container element

    -`// Adjust '40px' based on handle area/padding`

    - unneccessary explanations
